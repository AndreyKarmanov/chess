# This is chess
# Need for Andrey:
# available moves for currently selected pieces
# list of where all the pieces are > maybe we jsut don't bother and I make it simpler but less efficent.

tl;dr 
got rid of spot class, moved the functionality to pieces class
class game is now class chess, and has board's resetboard() method
need to implement getMoves() for each piece (returning a list of x/y coords like I did in pawn class)

you can check out gameWindow, there is one bug that I didn't bother fixing as this redesign was coming up but it is kinda cool

What I changed:
1. I got rid of the "spot" class 
> it only provided a x/y coordinate
> I moved the x/y fields into the pieces class, so now every pawn, rook etc. has an x/y stored inside it.
> we need that x/y coordinate in the individual pieces in order to calculate possible moves (and put them in a list for me)

2. I renamed class Game to class Chess
> perhaps we could make a simple class called Game and extend that with chess
> but if we aren't then we need to be more specific with what exactly the class does 

3. I moved the resetboard() from class board to class chess
> board class is very broad and shouldn't have a chess-specific method in it 
> this is perfect because we just changed Game to Chess so the method has a nice home. 

What the plan is for now: (if something doesn't make sense just ask, or if you think something could be better/more intuitive also tell me)
1. have each piece have a getMoves() method that returns the possible moves for that piece in a list [(x,y), (x2,y2)... ]
> look at the method I made for pawn
> whenever a player picks up a piece I will call this method and highlight the squares that they can put the piece on 
> I will only allow them to move to these squares. (this simplifies the move method in the chess class)

2. create a way of actually running the game
> Normally in a game we have to wait for some sort of input ( in this case a chess move )
> and program would wait on input("what is your name")
> but since this is graphicsal we can't just wait on the name, as the window has to be updated/checked for clicks
> this is a tomorrow problem 

3. win checking?
